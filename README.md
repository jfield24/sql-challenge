# SQL Employee Database Engineering and Analysis

---

## Project Description

The purpose of this project was to create an ERD of an employee database using QuickDBD, create this database in PostgreSQL, query the data for analysis and then import the database into Pandas using SQLAlchemy so it could be visualised.
- The `/EmployeeSQL/data` folder contains the csv files which were used to create the ERD and SQL database.
- The `/EmployeeSQL/solutions/ERD.PNG` file contains a graphic of the Entity Relationship Diagram created.
- The `/EmployeeSQL/solutions/table-schema.sql` file contains the SQL syntax used for creating the table schema of the database in PostgreSQL.
- The `/EmployeeSQL/solutions/queries.sql` file contains the SQL queries used for analysing the data.
- The `/EmployeeSQL/solutions/Bonus Analysis.ipynb`file contains some visualisations from the data.
